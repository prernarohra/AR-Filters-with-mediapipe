# AR Filters with Mediapipe :dog::cat:

Create and customize augmented reality (AR) filters using the powerful and efficient MediaPipe framework. This project uses real-time facial tracking and overlay techniques to bring AR experiences to life.

## 🌟 Features

- Real-time facial tracking with MediaPipe Face Mesh.
- Customizable AR filters, including effects like face masks, glasses, and more.
- Open-source and developer-friendly codebase for creative experimentation.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- MediaPipe: For real-time facial landmark detection and tracking.
- OpenCV: For image processing and visualization.
- Python: To integrate and process the entire workflow.
